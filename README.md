# CDDA Time Bandit

Adds the 'Time Jump Malfunction' scenario, using the Time Bandit profession. This scenario / profession setup is extremely unbalanced - created more for a casual start, rather than a balanced or difficult start, as a thinly veiled excuse to begin with the monoblade CBM.

## Scenario Infomation

They were supposed to land you sometime in the 18th century in the middle of the Vatican Secret Archives, but.. something has gone terribly wrong. With no recall point in this timeline you're stuck here, forever.

Location : Church or Graveyard
Both locations will be on fire, and surrounded by undead - this makes the graveyard a slightly easier start, though neither of the locations are hard given your starting abilities.

## Profession Infomation

Created by The Order to be the ultimate thief, grafted with all you may need, and sent back countless times to steal artifacts before they were lost to the shadows of history.

The Time Bandit is a supremely powerful character class starting with the integrated monoblade CBM installed, as well as a few other CBMs, and with the skill to use them. The martial style "Monoblade Training" is also included, which is simply a Time Bandit flavored version of Eskrima.
